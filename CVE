Jacob - Ubuntu DNS
CVE-2018-6553
The CUPS AppArmor profile incorrectly confined the dnssd backend due to use of hard links. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to escape confinement. This flaw affects versions prior to 2.2.7-1ubuntu2.1 in Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, prior to 2.2.4-7ubuntu3.1 in Ubuntu 17.10, prior to 2.1.3-4ubuntu0.5 in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, and prior to 1.7.2-0ubuntu1.10 in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

CVE-2017-6590
An issue was discovered in network-manager-applet (aka network-manager-gnome) in Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, 14.04 LTS, 16.04 LTS, and 16.10. A local attacker could use this issue at the default Ubuntu login screen to access local files and execute arbitrary commands as the lightdm user. The exploitation requires physical access to the locked computer and the Wi-Fi must be turned on. An access point that lets you use a certificate to login is required as well, but it's easy to create one. Then, it's possible to open a nautilus window and browse directories. One also can open some applications such as Firefox, which is useful for downloading malicious binaries.

In app/Controller/ServersController.php in MISP 2.4.87, a server setting permitted the override of a path variable on certain Red Hed Enterprise Linux and CentOS systems (where rh_shell_fix was enabled), and consequently allowed site admins to inject arbitrary OS commands. The impact is limited by the setting being only accessible to the site administrator.

cve-2017-5972
The TCP stack in the Linux kernel 3.x does not properly implement a SYN cookie protection mechanism for the case of a fast network connection, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) by sending many TCP SYN packets, as demonstrated by an attack against the kernel-3.10.0 package in CentOS Linux 7. NOTE: third parties have been unable to discern any relationship between the GitHub Engineering finding and the Trigemini.c attack code.

cve-2014-10033
SQL injection vulnerability in the update_zone function in catalog/admin/geo_zones.php in osCommerce Online Merchant 2.3.3.4 and earlier allows remote administrators to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the zID parameter in a list action.

cve-2012-5798
The PayPal Pro PayFlow EC module in osCommerce does not verify that the server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) or subjectAltName field of the X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via an arbitrary valid certificate.

Nathan â€“ Fedora RoundCube Mail
CVE-2015-5741 The net/http library in net/http/transfer.go in Go before 1.4.3 does not properly parse HTTP headers, which allows remote attackers to conduct HTTP request smuggling attacks via a request that contains Content-Length and Transfer-Encoding header fields.  Published: February 08, 2020; 02:15:10 PM -05:00

CVE-2014-4172
A URL parameter injection vulnerability was found in the back-channel ticket validation step of the CAS protocol in Jasig Java CAS Client before 3.3.2, .NET CAS Client before 1.0.2, and phpCAS before 1.3.3 that allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the (1) service parameter to validation/AbstractUrlBasedTicketValidator.java or (2) pgtUrl parameter to validation/Cas20ServiceTicketValidator.java.
Sam - Windows AD
CVE-2019-9510
A vulnerability in Microsoft Windows 10 1803 and Windows Server 2019 and later systems can allow authenticated RDP-connected clients to gain access to user sessions without needing to interact with the Windows lock screen. Should a network anomaly trigger a temporary RDP disconnect, Automatic Reconnection of the RDP session will be restored to an unlocked state, regardless of how the remote system was left. By interrupting network connectivity of a system, an attacker with access to a system being used as a Windows RDP client can gain access to a connected remote system, regardless of whether or not the remote system was locked. This issue affects Microsoft Windows 10, version 1803 and later, and Microsoft Windows Server 2019, version 2019 and later.
CVE-2019-0056
This issue only affects devices with three (3) or more MPC10's installed in a single chassis with OSPF enabled and configured on the device. An Insufficient Resource Pool weakness allows an attacker to cause the device's Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) states to transition to Down, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. This attack requires a relatively large number of specific Internet Mixed (IMIXed) types of genuine and valid IPv6 packets to be transferred by the attacker in a relatively short period of time, across three or more PFE's on the device at the same time. Continued receipt of the traffic sent by the attacker will continue to cause OSPF to remain in the Down starting state, or flap between other states and then again to Down, causing a persistent Denial of Service. This attack will affect all IPv4, and IPv6 traffic served by the OSPF routes once the OSPF states transition to Down. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX480, MX960, MX2008, MX2010, MX2020: 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R2-S4, 18.1R3-S5; 18.1X75 version 18.1X75-D10 and later versions; 18.2 versions prior to 18.2R1-S5, 18.2R2-S3, 18.2R3; 18.2X75 versions prior to 18.2X75-D50; 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R1-S4, 18.3R2, 18.3R3; 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R1-S2, 18.4R2.


Nolan - Overall Windows/Fill
CVE-2020-1975
Missing XML validation vulnerability in the PAN-OS web interface on Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software allows authenticated users to inject arbitrary XML that results in privilege escalation. This issue affects PAN-OS 8.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 8.1.12 and PAN-OS 9.0 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.0.6. This issue does not affect PAN-OS 7.1, PAN-OS 8.0, or PAN-OS 9.1 or later versions.

CVE-2020-1976
A denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability in Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect software running on Mac OS allows authenticated local users to cause the Mac OS kernel to hang or crash. This issue affects GlobalProtect 5.0.5 and earlier versions of GlobalProtect 5.0 on Mac OS.
